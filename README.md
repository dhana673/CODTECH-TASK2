### Overview of the Online Marketplace Project

This **Online Marketplace System** is a Python-based program that mimics a simplified version of an e-commerce platform like Amazon or eBay. It allows users to buy and sell products, add reviews, filter and search for items, and manage seller storefronts. The system includes basic functionalities for handling products, sellers, and customer interactions with reviews and ratings.

#### Key Features:

1. **Seller Storefronts**:
   - Sellers can register and create their storefronts.
   - Sellers can add products to their storefronts, which are visible to customers browsing or searching the marketplace.

2. **Product Listings**:
   - Products have details such as name, description, price, category, and image.
   - Customers can view product details, read reviews, and see the average ratings.
   - Each product can be listed with an image file path (like "laptop.jpg") to represent a product image.

3. **Reviews and Ratings**:
   - Users can leave reviews and ratings for products.
   - Products display their average rating based on customer feedback, helping new customers make purchase decisions.
   
4. **Search and Filtering**:
   - Customers can search for products by name.
   - Products can be filtered by category (e.g., "Electronics" or "Books") and/or maximum price, allowing customers to find products that match their preferences and budget.

5. **Product Display**:
   - Each product has a detailed view, showing its name, description, price, image, average rating, and customer reviews.

6. **Basic Marketplace Operations**:
   - The marketplace supports basic operations such as adding products, displaying seller storefronts, searching for products, and filtering by criteria such as category or price.

#### Key Components:

1. **Product Class**:
   - Represents a single product with attributes like name, description, price, category, image, reviews, and ratings.
   - Includes methods to add reviews, calculate average ratings, and display product details.

2. **Seller Class**:
   - Represents a seller in the marketplace.
   - Each seller has a storefront where they can add multiple products.
   - Includes methods to add products to the seller's storefront and display all products in the storefront.

3. **Marketplace Class**:
   - Represents the overall marketplace.
   - Manages multiple sellers and products.
   - Provides functionality for registering new sellers, adding products to the marketplace, searching for products, and filtering products by category and price.

4. **Review and Rating System**:
   - Allows customers to provide feedback on products by adding reviews and ratings.
   - Each product can have multiple reviews and ratings, and the average rating is calculated and displayed.

#### Program Flow:

1. **Seller Registration**:
   - Sellers can register in the marketplace and set up their storefronts. For example, "John's Electronics" and "Alice's Bookstore" are two sellers in the system.

2. **Adding Products**:
   - Sellers add products to their storefronts, which are also visible in the general marketplace. Products include attributes like name, price, category, and image.

3. **Searching and Filtering**:
   - Customers can search for products by name or filter products by category and maximum price. For example, searching for "laptop" displays all products matching that name, while filtering by "Electronics" and price range helps narrow down options.

4. **Adding Reviews and Ratings**:
   - Customers can add reviews and ratings to products they have purchased. The system stores these reviews and calculates an average rating for each product.

5. **Displaying Products and Storefronts**:
   - The marketplace can display detailed product information, including average ratings and customer reviews.
   - Seller storefronts can also be viewed, showing all products offered by a specific seller.

#### Example Usage:

1. **Adding a Product**:
   - A seller like "John's Electronics" adds products to their storefront, such as a laptop or smartphone. The products become available for customers to search and view in the marketplace.

2. **Searching for a Product**:
   - A customer searches for "laptop" and finds a high-performance laptop listed by John's Electronics. They can read the description, see the price, and check customer reviews before deciding to purchase.

3. **Filtering Products**:
   - A customer wants to browse products in the "Electronics" category under $800. The filtering functionality shows only those products that match the specified criteria.

4. **Adding a Review**:
   - After purchasing a laptop, a customer leaves a review saying "Great laptop, fast performance!" with a 5-star rating. The review is stored, and the average rating for the laptop is updated.

5. **Displaying Seller Storefronts**:
   - A customer can view all products available from a specific seller, such as John's Electronics, seeing a full list of their offerings along with descriptions, prices, and ratings.

#### Potential Future Enhancements:
- **User Accounts**: Add functionality for customer accounts and order history tracking.
- **Cart and Checkout System**: Implement a shopping cart and checkout process to simulate purchasing products.
- **Product Recommendations**: Use algorithms to suggest products to customers based on their browsing and purchasing behavior.
- **Inventory Management**: Track product stock levels and manage quantities for each product.
- **Payment Integration**: Simulate payments and manage order processing.

This **Online Marketplace** project provides a basic framework for e-commerce platforms with functionality for managing products, sellers, reviews, and user interactions. It serves as a foundation for building more advanced online shopping systems.
